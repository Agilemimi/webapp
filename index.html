            <h2>Section One: Introduction to Web Development</h2>
            <p>
                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The field of web development generally refers to the main non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2">
            <h2>Section Two: Frontend Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                Frontend development focuses on the user-facing side of a website. It involves creating the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with directly. Key technologies include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> The structure of web content.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> The styling and visual presentation.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> The interactivity and dynamic behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular are commonly used to build complex single-page applications.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section3">
            <h2>Section Three: Backend Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                Backend development deals with the server-side logic and database management. It ensures the website functions correctly by handling data storage, server requests, and application logic. Common backend languages and frameworks include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> Django, Flask</li>
                <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Express.js</li>
                <li><strong>Ruby:</strong> Ruby on Rails</li>
                <li><strong>PHP:</strong> Laravel, Symfony</li>
                <li><strong>Java:</strong> Spring Boot</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis are crucial for storing and retrieving data.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section4">
            <h2>Section Four: Fullstack Development</h2>
            <p>
                Fullstack development refers to the practice of working on both the frontend and backend of a web application. A fullstack developer possesses skills in both client-side and server-side technologies, allowing them to build an entire application from start to finish.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach often involves choosing a "stack" of technologies that work well together, such as the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) or the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="section5">
            <h2>Section Five: Deployment and Hosting</h2>
            <p>
                Once a web application is developed, it needs to be deployed to a server so that it can be accessed by users on the internet. This involves hosting the application on a cloud platform or a dedicated server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Popular hosting providers and platforms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Netlify (for static sites and Jamstack)</li>
                <li>Vercel (for Next.js, React, and serverless functions)</li>
                <li>Heroku (Platform as a Service)</li>
                <li>AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure (Infrastructure as a Service)</li>
                <li>GitHub Pages (for simple static sites)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Setting up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can automate the deployment process.
